## Python tooling

- Python has a more mature and robust ecosystem for formatting and linting (helped by the fact that it doesn't have a million distinct dialects). We recommend using those tools to format and lint your code in the style you prefer.

- Our current recommendations are
  - [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) formatter
  - [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) linter
