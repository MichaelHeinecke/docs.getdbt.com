## Fields and model names

- Models should be pluralized, e.g. `customers`, `orders`, `products`.
- Each model should have a primary key.
- Do not use abbreviations or aliases, emphasize readability over brevity, e.g. `cust` for `customer` or `o` for `orders`.
- The primary key of a model should be named `<object>_id`, e.g. `account_id` â€“ this makes it easier to know what `id` is being referenced in downstream joined models.
- Keys should be string data types.
- Booleans should be prefixed with `is_` or `has_`.
- Timestamp columns should be named `<event>_at`, e.g. `created_at`, and should be in UTC. If a different timezone is being used, this should be indicated with a suffix, e.g `created_at_pt`.
- Dates should be named `<event>_date`, e.g. `created_date`.
- Price/revenue fields should be in decimal currency (e.g. `19.99` for $19.99; many app databases store prices as integers in cents). If non-decimal currency is used, indicate this with suffix, e.g. `price_in_cents`.
- Avoid reserved words as column names.
- Consistency is key! Use the same field names across models where possible, e.g. a key to the `customers` table should be named `customer_id` rather than `user_id` or 'id'.
- Schema, table and column names should be in `snake_case`.
- Use names based on the _business_ terminology, rather than the source terminology. For example, if the source database uses `user_id` but the business calls them `customer_id`, use `customer_id` in the model.
- Versions of models should use the suffix `_v1`, `_v2`, etc for consistency, e.g. `customers_v1`, `customers_v2`.
